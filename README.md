This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **elm-pages** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **elm-pages** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.


# How it works

> This application was built with [elm-pages](https://elm-pages.com), a tool for building full-stack type-safe Elm applications!

# Getting started
